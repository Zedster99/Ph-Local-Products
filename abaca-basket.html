            <p>Abaca baskets are handcrafted by local artisans in the Philippines. Made from strong abaca fibers, these baskets are perfect for home decor and storage.

Abaca fibers may also be used to make a wide range of handcrafted items, including clothing, textiles, sporting goods, packaging materials, and ornaments.
                One of the local products in the Philippines is the abaca basket, which may be used for a variety of purposes, such as a planter, a small hamper, a decorative item, and much more. Abaca, a local natural commodity, has long been employed in Bicol’s customary planting methods.
