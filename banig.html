            <h3>Product Description</h3>
            <p>Banig is a traditional Filipino mat made from woven reeds or grass. It is often used for sleeping, sitting, or as a decorative piece in Filipino households.
                According to the website of the National Commission on Culture and the Arts (NCCA), banig is a traditional handwoven mat created in the Philippines. It is not, technically, a textile. Furthermore, the mat is composed of buri (palm), pandan or seagrass leaves, or native leaves, depending on the area in the Philippines. The leaves are dried and frequently colored before being chopped into strips and woven into mats that might be simple or elaborate.
