            <h3>History of Abaniko</h3>
            <p>Abaniko, or hand fans, have been used in Filipino culture for centuries. They are made with exquisite craftsmanship and are a part of Filipino daily life, especially during warm weather.
                Its name takes after the Spanish word abanico, meaning “fan.” Collected in the early 20th century, this fan was likely used by a Filipino woman similar to how abanicos were used for women in Spanish society. These social practices, dubbed “fan language,” sent discrete messages by young women to potential suitors.
