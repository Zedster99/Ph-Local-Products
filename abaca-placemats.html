            <h3>Product Description</h3>
            <p>Abaca placemats are handwoven using natural fibers from the abaca plant. They add a rustic and eco-friendly touch to your dining table.
                Manila hemp, like abaca baskets, may be fashioned into beautiful and organic table sets such as placemats. Traditionally, they may be seen at ancestral homes on the outskirts of Manila. Filipinos pioneered eco-friendly kitchen goods long before the rest of the world. These placemats are organic table settings that are both environmentally friendly and aesthetically stylish. These meal-setting buddies will undoubtedly make your eating experience homier and create an organic feel. Many of the dinner companions may be found in Kultura Filipino at SM Ayala, Makati City.
