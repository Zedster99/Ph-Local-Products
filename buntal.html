            <h3>Product Description</h3>
            <p>The Buntal hat is a traditional Filipino accessory made from natural fibers. Handcrafted by local artisans, each hat is unique and built for durability and style.
                    The buntal hat is a traditional handwoven straw hat from the Philippines, crafted from fine, durable fibers extracted from the petioles of the buri palm tree (Corypha elata), a species native to the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia. 
                Its primary production centers are in Baliwag, Bulacan, and historically in Sariaya and Tayabas, Quezon Province, where the buri palm is abundant. Buntal fibers are prized for their smooth texture, flexibility, and strength, making them ideal for weaving lightweight yet sturdy hats. 
                Originally designed as wide-brimmed hats for farmers, buntal hats later evolved into more refined versions resembling fedoras, often mistaken for Panama hats or sold under the name Bangkok hats. The Baliwag-made hats, known as balibuntal hats, are regarded as superior in quality, with a silkier texture than their counterparts. 
                These hats are versatile, pairing well with both informal attire and the traditional barong tagalog. Women’s variations, such as the wide-brimmed baliwag hat, also showcase the adaptability of buntal weaving.
                During the first half of the 20th century, buntal hats were a major export, celebrated for their unique craftsmanship and elegant, lightweight design.

            <h3>History of Buntal Hat</h3>
            <p>The Buntal hat has been a part of Filipino culture for centuries. Traditionally worn for protection against the sun, it is now a fashionable item used in various cultural events.
                Originally, buntal products were primarily produced in the towns of Sariaya and Tayabas, due to the buri palm plantations in Quezon Province. The industry expanded into Baliuag, Bulacan between 1907 to 1909, originally introduced by Mariano Deveza who originally hailed from Lucban, Quezon. Introducing buntal products weaving to Baliuag was easy since the town already had a preexisting weaving industry producing textiles, pañuelos (kerchiefs), tapis, as well as woven hats made from bamboo straw. Buntal products production in Baliuag was further enhanced by Dolores Maniquis who softened the fibers through the use of a wooden roller known as an iluhan. 

                    In the year 1923, Chinese producers from Hong Kong hired Buntal weavers from the Philippines. Having acquired the weaving process, they then began to mass produce. This affected the local industry to such an extent that Representative Antonio Villarama tried to pass a bill to ban the export of buntal fiber (though it failed).[4]
                Because of competition from Chinese factories, the buntal industry waned until the 1960s when it was again revived by the Villones family from Sariaya, Quezon. Their products were mostly sourced from suppliers from Baliuag, although they also bought products from nearby towns in Bulacan, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija. Their products were primarily exported to the United States, Mexico, and Italy. The family accounted for around a quarter of the total monthly production of buntal hats in the 1960s.

                    The industry, however, is once again in danger of extinction due to the growing lack of skilled workers and the declining demand. Most remaining weavers of buntal are elderly. The government of Baliuag has been taking measures to promote buntal products to the local market.
                In 2011, Rosario Quizon-Decasa, one of the last remaining weavers in Baliuag, also started a project to teach buntal weaving skills to inmates in the Bulacan Provincial Jail, due to the lack of interest among youths in Bulacan.
