            <h3>Product Description</h3>
            <p>Walis Tambo is a traditional Filipino broom made from soft palm leaves. It is widely used in Filipino homes for cleaning and sweeping outdoor areas.
                Walis Tambo is a Philippine cultural icon. The Tambo is much more than a broom. It is a component of Filipinos’ daily lives. It results in a gleaming and clean floor. It is convenient and may be used anywhere in the house (but not the bathroom as a mop or a walis tingting might be more useful). The soft bristles are created from the phragmites reed known as tambo in the Philippines, thus the name walis tambo. The reeds bloom in December, and the blossoms are harvested to produce the walis tambo, a popular Filipino dish.
                Walis Tambo also has different Filipino brands and one of them is the Baguio City brand, which ranges from Php 115.00 to Php 200.
